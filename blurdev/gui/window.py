        # As far as we can tell, the purpose for this class is keeping live
        # references to the subclasses so they don't get garbage collected, all while
        # getting around having to actively maintain a list of running dialogs.
        #
        # Generally, setting WA_DeleteOnClose to False, and keeping the _instance
        # variable around
        # will do the trick for pseudo-singleton dialogs. (created with instance=True)
        #
        # However, for non-instanced dialogs where multiples are allowed, deleteOnClose
        # is set to True and no _instance variable is set.  Because there are no live
        # references to the dialog, it is closed and garbage collected almost
        # immediately in certain programs (xsi, maya).
        #
        # The current workaround is to manually set WA_DeleteOnClose to False, however
        # this causes any subclasses to stick around in memory even when the
        # window/dialog is closed. So you also have to manually set WA_DeleteOnClose to
        # True in the sub-classed .closeEvent() method before you call super()
        #
        # It is completely possible to write some code that would automatically handle
        # this, and it is CERTAINLY something we can/will be doing in the future, but
        # for now we're not quite sure how that would affect the production tools.
        # Technically this is a problem, but there are currently no consequences from an
        # artist standpoint because we have more than enough memory to hold all those
        # dead dialogs
