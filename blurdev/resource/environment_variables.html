	<h2>blurdev Site variables:</h2>
	<p><span style=" font-style:italic;">These variables should be defined at a user or system level to configure blurdev.</span></p>
	<p><span style=" font-weight:bold;">BDEV_INCLUDE_*:</span> Contains a path that is inserted at index zero of sys.path. This is done in reverse alphabetical order.</p>
	<p><span style=" font-weight:bold;">BDEV_DESIGNERPLUG_*:</span> Used to add a collection of designer plugins to QDesigner. Should be set to "XMLPATH,MODULE_DIR". XMLPATH is the full path to a xml file listing plugins to load. MODULE_DIR is a path that needs added to sys.path so the modules in XMLPATH are importable. You can use environment variables in these strings, they will be expanded. This is used by QDesigner, nothing else.</p>
	<p><span style=" font-weight:bold;">BLURLIBSPATH:</span> Adds blurdev widgets to QtDesigner. It should contain the path to the folder containing the blurdev module. This is used by QDesigner, nothing else. This is used to populate BDEV_DESIGNERPLUG_BLUR with the correct values in settings.ini.</p>
	<p><span style=" font-weight:bold;">BDEV_OFFLINE:</span> If set to 1, this indicates that blurdev is not running on the "Blur" network. This causes the [* Offline] section of blurdev/resource/settings.ini to override the [Default] and [*] sections. When blurdev is imported it adds all env vars defined in settings.ini for the current operating system  and Default if they are not already defined in os.environ.</p>
	<p><span style=" font-weight:bold;">BDEV_PATH_PREFS:</span> This environment variable points to where per-computer user prefs are stored.</p>
	<p><span style=" font-weight:bold;">BDEV_PATH_PREFS_SHARED:</span> This environment variable points to where shared user prefs are stored. This is often on the network and includes the os's logged in username in the path. If BDEV_OFFLINE is set to 1 this may point to the BDEV_PATH_PREFS location.</p>
	<p></p>
	<h2>blurdev Temp variables:</h2>
	<p><span style=" font-style:italic;">These variables should not be defined all the time.</span></p>
	<p><span style=" font-weight:bold;">BDEV_DISABLE_AUTORUN:</span> Set to "true" to disable the autorun.bat script used at blur. If this is not set when Maya shuts down, maya takes minutes to close. Maya uses several subprocess calls when closing and for some reason the doskey calls in the script take much longer than normal.</p>
	<p><span style=" font-weight:bold;">BDEV_STYLESHEET:</span> Used to override the stylesheet when initalizing blurdev.</p>
	<p><span style=" font-weight:bold;">BDEV_TOOL_ENVIRONMENT:</span> Forces blurdev to initialize with this treegrunt environment name. When saving prefs, this environment name change will not be saved. This is mostly used to ensure that launching a subprocess or farm job happens on the same treegrunt environment.</p>
	<p></p>
	<h2>Sentry variables:</h2>
	<p><span style=" font-style:italic;">These variables control the behavior of Sentry's integration in blurdev.</span></p>
	<p><span style=" font-weight:bold;">SENTRY_DSN:</span> Required for Sentry to initialize, defines the endpoint for Sentry to submit error events.</p>
	<p><span style=" font-weight:bold;">SENTRY_DEBUG:</span> If set to 1 (or any value), Sentry will be initialized in debug mode providing granular output related to the underlying Sentry API (such as startup process progress and output for event transmission).</p>
	<p><span style=" font-weight:bold;">BDEV_SENTRY_AT_STARTUP:</span> Sets up Sentry earlier in blurdev startup process. By default, Sentry is configured upon core initialization.</p>
	<p></p>
	<h1>trax</h1>
	<hr>
	<p><span style=" font-weight:bold;">BDEV_INCLUDE_TRAX:</span> A special BDEV_INCLUDE_* environment variable that specifies where trax can be imported from. It should contain the path to the <b>folder containing the trax folder</b>(for instance: C:\blur\it\python\apps). It is used by the blurpath system to ensure the correct build is imported. It can also be used to make testing development easier by pointing to your local checkout.</p>
	<p><span style=" font-weight:bold;">TRAX_SPOOL_DIRECTORY_OVERRIDE:</span> If defined, all messages will be stored the directory of this variable. Each message filename will have a "[mapping.mount()]_" prefix added giving you a hint to which server it would have ended up on. Defining this variable effectively disables all spool messages, and gives you a way to see what each spool message would look like. If your code depends on trax.api.spool.waitForCompletion, it will never complete.</p>
	<p><span style=" font-weight:bold;">TRAXDEVPATH:</span> Adds trax widgets to QtDesigner. It should contain the path to the folder containing the trax module. This is used by QDesigner, nothing else. This is used to populate BDEV_DESIGNERPLUG_TRAX with the correct values in settings.ini.</p>
	<h1>Notes</h1>
	<hr>
	<p>Any variable names containing a * are wildcards. This allows you to add as many instances of that environment variable type as needed.</p>
